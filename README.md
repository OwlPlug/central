[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/owlplug/central.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/owlplug/central)

This repository is an effort to bring collaborative and secure plugin distribution in OwlPlug Central. A Github based flow with forks and pull requests allows developers to control how their plugins are distributed in OwlPlug central. Rely on git LFS to store binaries is the easiest way but not the most suitable considering Github storage and bandwidth limitations.
